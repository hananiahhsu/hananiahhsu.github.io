### About

  I bridge mechanical engineering and software development to build production-grade tools for design, simulation, and visualization. With a background in mechanical system design and optimization, I translate real-world engineering constraints into robust, high-performance code—streamlining workflows and improving accuracy. My work spans desktop engineering applications, computer graphics/rendering, CAD/BIM platforms (including IFC interoperability), parametric/“intelligent” 3D design, and simulation tooling for solar thermal and pressure-vessel scenarios. In C++ and Python, I deliver clean architectures, reliable algorithms, and practical automation that reduce cycle time and raise product quality. I thrive in dynamic teams where deep engineering meets modern software craft. 

### Focus areas 

1. Computer Graphics & Desktop Engineering Apps (rendering pipelines, interactive 3D tooling) 
2. Building-Design Software (architecture/interior), BIM/IFC interoperability
3. 3D Intelligent/Parametric Design and optimization 
4. Solar-Water-Heating system modeling, simulation, and performance analysis 
5. Pressure-Vessel design and verification

### Education
